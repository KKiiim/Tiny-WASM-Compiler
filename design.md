### R28 For JIT OperandStack Addr

Use r28 storage as JIT runtime operand stack top address. No validation, assume OperandStack always safe.  
Compiler will check the matching of local.get/local.set stuff before emit jit code.

### Max Support 8 Params WASM Function

## TODO
1. Only save dirty register before call. Need record register usage reference
2. Remove JIT runtime operandStack can reduce memory access a lot. Maintain some reference in Compiler level.
3. Use memory+ptr to increase function params
